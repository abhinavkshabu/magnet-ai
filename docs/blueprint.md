# **App Name**: AI Canvas

## Core Features:

- Visual Workflow Designer: Drag-and-drop interface for visually creating AI and IoT workflows using a node-based system.
- AI Node Library: Library of AI nodes for tasks like image analysis, text generation, and speech recognition. Ability to add nodes representing actions using services like OpenAI, Gemini, and Groq
- IoT Node Integration: Nodes that interface with IoT devices (sensors, robots, home automation systems), allowing AI workflows to control and interact with the physical world.
- Real-time Execution Engine: Executes workflows instantly, enabling real-time testing, editing, and deployment of AI-driven applications.
- AI-Powered Node Suggestion Tool: AI tool that suggests the next nodes to add to the canvas, and suggests paths and explores ‘what-if’ scenarios based on the current workflow context.
- Webhook Trigger: Allows workflows to be triggered by incoming HTTP requests using the specified URL https://api.example.com/webhook/123

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 75%, 50% (which converts to hex code #3FB1FF). This bright, saturated blue is suitable for a bold styling and provides a strong contrast on the light background.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (which converts to hex code #F0F6FF). It’s a very light tint of the primary color, offering a subtle background that doesn’t distract from the nodes.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 65%, 40% (which converts to hex code #29A69B). As an analogous hue, this vibrant teal is distinctive from the blue, and it’s highly desaturated and darkened so as not to draw too much attention. It will primarily be used for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif with a techy, scientific feel that works well for headlines and short amounts of body text; Body text: 'Inter' as the workhorse of the pair, Inter's clean, neutral appearance is well-suited for longer pieces of content.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets and configurations within the nodes.
- Use clear, modern icons to represent different AI models, IoT devices, and actions within the workflow nodes.
- Subtle animations on node connections and data flow to visually represent the workflow execution in real-time.
